# Tips to write better code

Two Word Answer : Practice & Endurance

Now, once you have a good working knowledge of any one programming language, the following tips may become handy:

- Indentation

  Try to properly indent your code.
  
  eg. 
  
  if(condition)
  {
  
       //statement
    
  }
    
  Style is important, not to make code look pretty, but because it helps with reading, editing, and understanding.
    
- Comments
  Comments help you to explain the code to others. Comments will help you and others understand why you did what you did. It may seem obvious to you when you are writing it, but     will others who work on the code understand it? Will you remember what you did after a month or a year?

-Naming
  Try to use proper names for the variables.
  eg.  CASE 1: int a=5;
       CASE 2: int numberOfIndividuals=5;
       
       As seen from above, the second CASE looks more friendly and is easier to understand as compared to first.
